**3D printed case (STL + assembly):** [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2872376-esp32-plane-radar-live-ads-b-on-a-round-display#profileId-3207083) · **Firmware:** [Releases](https://github.com/MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar/releases)

Firmware for an **ESP32-C3 Super Mini** and a **1.28″ round GC9A01** display (240×240). Shows a circular **ADS-B radar** around your configured location, with **WiFiManager** for first-time setup.

## What it does

1. **Wi‑Fi setup** (if needed) — captive portal on AP **`PlaneRadar-Setup`**
2. **Radar** — live aircraft from [adsb.fi](https://opendata.adsb.fi/) on a sonar-style grid

After Wi‑Fi is saved, the device reconnects automatically; the radar runs in the main loop with periodic ADS-B updates (~5 s).

## Controls (BOOT, GPIO 9, active LOW)

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Short tap** | Cycle range preset (5 → 10 → 15 → 25 km); saved to flash |
| **Double tap** | Stop following the flight (`follow_id` cleared). Only with a flight followed: otherwise the second tap is swallowed, never a double range change |
| **Hold 3 s** | Clear Wi‑Fi, location, units, follow target and MQTT config; reboot into setup portal |

A single tap is held back for **350 ms** (`kDoubleTapWindowMs`) so a second one can cancel it;
that is why the range changes just after the tap, not during it.

During setup you can also hold BOOT at power-on to force a credential reset (same as the long press).

## Wi‑Fi setup portal

**First-time setup** (no saved Wi‑Fi):

1. Connect to **`PlaneRadar-Setup`**
2. Open **`http://plane-radar.local`** (preferred) or **`http://192.168.4.1`** — both are shown on the yellow setup screen; captive portal may open automatically
3. Set home Wi‑Fi, then save

**Reconfigure anytime** (after the device is on your network):

1. Open **`http://plane-radar.local`** or **`http://<device-ip>`** (e.g. from your router or serial log at boot)
2. Change Wi‑Fi, location, units, or runway overlay; save

The same portal runs on the setup AP and on the device’s LAN IP while connected to Wi‑Fi. mDNS hostname is `plane-radar` → **plane-radar.local** (`kPortalHostname` in `config.h`). Some clients resolve `.local` slowly; use the IP if needed.

**Custom fields** (stored in NVS):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Latitude / Longitude** | Radar center and ADS-B query position (defaults in `config.h` until set) |
| **Display distances in miles** | Ring scale label in **mi** instead of **km** (e.g. `6mi` vs `10km`) |
| **Show airport runways** | Major-airport runway overlay on the radar (off to hide) |
| **Follow flight** | Callsign (e.g. `GLO1724`) or Mode-S hex (6 hex digits) of the flight to follow. **Blank = off** |
| **Publish to Home Assistant (MQTT)** | Master switch. **Off by default**: with no broker host the radar never tries to connect |
| **MQTT broker host / port** | Broker address; port empty = `1883`. Plain TCP only (see below) |
| **MQTT username / password** | Broker credentials, stored in NVS. Sent only to the broker |
| **MQTT base topic** | Empty = `planeradar/<chip-id>`. Two radars need two different topics |
| **HA discovery prefix** | Empty = `homeassistant`. Change it only if your HA uses a custom one |
| **Device name in Home Assistant** | Empty = `Plane Radar` |

Every MQTT text field starts **empty** on purpose: the firmware ships no broker address, and the
hint is shown as a placeholder, never as a pre-filled value.

After a reset, the device reboots and shows the setup screen immediately (no “Connecting” loop on stale credentials).

## Radar display

### Grid

- Dark blue background, subdued green rings and crosshairs
- White **N / S / E / W** at the bezel; range label on the **east** spoke (ring 3 = ¾ of outer radius)
- White center dot

Layout and colors: `include/ui/radar_theme.h`.

### Range presets

| Ring 3 label | Outer radius (aircraft scale) |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| 5 km / 3 mi | ~6.7 km |
| 10 km / 6 mi | ~13.3 km (default) |
| 15 km / 9 mi | ~20 km |
| 25 km / 16 mi | ~33.3 km |

Preset and miles/km choice persist across reboot (`planeradar` NVS namespace).

### Runways

- Major airports from OurAirports (`large_airport`); all open runway strips in range (helipads excluded)
- Teal runway lines with one ICAO label per airport (e.g. `KJFK`); toggle in the Wi‑Fi setup portal
- Update the embedded list: `python3 scripts/build_large_airports.py`

### Aircraft

- **Inside the outer ring** — red heading triangle, magenta speed vector (clipped at the ring), callsign / type / altitude tags
- **Outside the ring** (still within ADS-B fetch) — small **red dot on the screen rim** at the correct bearing (direction cue; not distance-accurate past the ring)
- **Tags** — placed toward the **center**: west (left) → tag on the **right** of the symbol; east (right) → tag on the **left**

As range decreases (or aircraft approach), targets move inward; beyond-ring dots become full symbols when they cross the outer ring.

### ADS-B

- Source: `https://opendata.adsb.fi/api/v3/`
- Fetch radius: `ui::radar::fetchRadiusKm()` — scales with the active preset to roughly the screen edge (so rim dots have data)
- Poll interval: `kAdsbFetchIntervalMs` (5 s) in `config.h`
- Ground aircraft hidden by default (`kAdsbShowGroundAircraft`)

### Follow a flight

Set **Follow flight** in the portal and the radar stops watching the neighbourhood and starts
watching one aircraft: the scope recentres on it, its path is drawn behind it, and a readout
replaces the empty space below it.

- **Recentring** — every frame, with a **6 px dead-band** so a jittery fix cannot make the rings
  crawl. The whole scope moves: rings, runways, projection and fetch centre.
- **Trail** — the last 64 fixes (about 5 minutes at the 5 s poll), drawn dim amber. A sample
  outside the scope breaks the line rather than being clipped onto the rim.
- **Readout** — two lines: callsign and state on top (in the aircraft colour), then the current
  numbers.

| State | Meaning | Readout |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `LIVE` | Airborne now (ground speed ≥ 40 kt, not reported on the ground) | `gs 412 kt` |
| `ON GROUND` | Seen at the airport, never airborne yet this session | `gs 0 kt` |
| `NOT LIVE` | Configured but not in the feed | `no position` plus the age of the last fix |
| `LANDED` | Was airborne this session, now on the ground or gone | `block 1h05` |

**Data sources.** Live positions come only from **adsb.fi** (`opendata.adsb.fi`), one request per
second at most — the followed flight is looked up every poll, the surrounding traffic every third
one. Nothing else is queried: the firmware shows what the feed reports, so there is no origin, no
destination and no ETA. Both were dropped on purpose — callsign-to-route databases are static
snapshots, and a reused callsign made them name the wrong city pair with confidence.

**No wall clock.** The firmware has no SNTP and no RTC, so the readout shows durations, never clock
times: `block` is the time observed airborne, and `no position` carries the age of the last fix.
"Landed at 14:32" cannot be printed without adding a time source.

**Credit.** ADS-B data courtesy of [adsb.fi](https://adsb.fi) — please consider feeding them a
receiver.

## Configuration

Edit **`include/config.h`** for hardware and behavior:

| Area | Keys / notes |
|------|----------------|
| Portal | `kPortalApName`, `kPortalIp`, `kPortalHostname` / `kPortalHostUrl` (mDNS; needs `-DWM_MDNS` in `platformio.ini`) |
| Wi‑Fi timing | connect attempts, reconnect grace, portal timeout (`0` = no timeout) |
| BOOT | `kBootPin`, `kBootResetHoldMs`, `kBootTapMinMs` |
| Display SPI | pins, `kDisplayInvert`, `kDisplayRgbOrder`, `kDisplaySpiWriteHz` |
| Default location | `kDefaultRadarLat`, `kDefaultRadarLon` (until portal overrides) |
| ADS-B | `kAdsbFetchIntervalMs`, `kAdsbShowGroundAircraft` |
| MQTT | `kMqttDefaultPort`, `kMqttDefaultTopicPrefix`, `kMqttDefaultDiscoveryPrefix`, `kMqttDefaultDeviceName`, `kMqttStateIntervalMs`, `kMqttMinFreeHeap`, `kMqttPacketSize` (must equal `-DMQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE`) |

Range presets: `include/ui/radar_range.h` (`kRangePresets`).

## Home Assistant (MQTT)

The radar can publish itself to Home Assistant over MQTT with **auto-discovery**: no YAML on the HA
side, no entity to declare by hand. Fill in the MQTT fields in the config portal (see above), enable
**Publish to Home Assistant**, and the device appears as one HA device with twelve entities.

- **Discovery topics:** `<prefix>/<component>/<node>/<object>/config` (retained), where `<node>` is
  the base topic with `/` replaced by `_`, e.g. `homeassistant/select/planeradar_a1b2c3/range/config`.
- **Topics:** state on `<base>/state/<key>`, commands on `<base>/cmd/<key>`, availability on
  `<base>/status` (`online` / `offline` via MQTT last will).
- **Reload:** discovery is re-published on every connect, so the entities survive a broker restart.

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Range | `select` | Radar range preset (5 / 10 / 15 / 25 km) |
| Miles | `switch` | Ring labels in mi instead of km |
| Runways | `switch` | Airport runway overlay |
| Debug overlay | `switch` | Fetch-in-progress dot + Wi-Fi dBm on screen |
| Latitude / Longitude | `number` | Radar center; the grid redraws immediately |
| Aircraft in range | `sensor` | Aircraft currently in the ADS-B snapshot |
| Nearest aircraft | `sensor` | Callsign, with type/altitude/distance/speed/track as attributes |
| Wi-Fi RSSI | `sensor` | dBm |
| Free heap | `sensor` | Bytes; the radar skips telemetry below `kMqttMinFreeHeap` |
| Radar info | `sensor` | IP as state, SSID/uptime/firmware as attributes |
| Follow flight | `text` | Callsign (e.g. `GLO1724`) or Mode-S hex of the flight to follow; **blank = off**. Same field as the portal, settable from HA |

Commands are applied to NVS and **re-published as state**, so HA always shows the value the radar
actually accepted (an out-of-range coordinate is rejected, not echoed back).

**Broker requirements:** plain **TCP, no TLS**. The ESP32-C3 already runs a TLS client for the ADS-B
fetch (~50 KB of context); a second TLS handshake for MQTT does not fit the heap. Point it at port
`1883`. A dedicated broker user with write access limited to `planeradar/#` and `homeassistant/#` is
recommended — the credentials are stored unencrypted in NVS, and the LAN portal on port 80 is not
authenticated.

### Web-flashable release image

Single `.bin` for [esptool-js](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) and similar tools (ESP32-C3, 4 MB, flash at **0x0**):

```bash
chmod +x scripts/merge-firmware.sh   # once
./scripts/merge-firmware.sh
```

Writes `release/plane-radar-merged.bin`. Skip rebuild if firmware is already built:

```bash
./scripts/merge-firmware.sh --no-build
```

Or via PlatformIO only (output: `.pio/build/supermini/firmware-merged.bin`):

```bash
pio run -e supermini
pio run -t merge -e supermini
```

Put the board in download mode (hold **BOOT**, tap **RESET**), then flash with Chrome/Edge over USB.

### CI and releases (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow | When | Output |
|----------|------|--------|
| [Build](.github/workflows/build.yml) | Push / PR to `main` | Artifact `plane-radar-supermini` (merged + split `.bin` files, ~90 days) |
| [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) | Git tag `v*` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) | GitHub Release asset `plane-radar-v1.0.0.bin` + `.sha256` |

To ship a version users can download:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The release workflow builds firmware in CI and attaches the merged image to the release. Download from **Releases** on GitHub, then flash at **0x0** (ESP32-C3, 4 MB).

## Dependencies

- [LovyanGFX](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX)
- [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager)
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) — MQTT. Built with
  `-DMQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE=768`: the default (256 B) truncates discovery payloads silently, because
  the ceiling covers topic + payload + header together.
